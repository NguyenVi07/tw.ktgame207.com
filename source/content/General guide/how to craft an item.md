how to craft an item?

this is a question many people have when playing this game



but, here I am, I'm going to guide everyone

1. press 'i' to open your backpack, find an item and put it in your left hand

2. next, find another item and put it in your right hand

3. next, press escape to exit the backpack

4. simply press 't', if the recipe is correct, it will combine them into something for you

good luck
